This document is material for the practical session of the Computational Metagenomics (BioSB Advanced course) on Wednesday morning. It covers:

- **Loading and Preparing Data**: Loading microbiome species abundance and phenotype data, cleaning taxonomy names, and rescaling data.
- **Alpha Diversity**: Calculating Shannon diversity and species richness metrics, followed by statistical testing.
- **Beta Diversity**: Performing Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) to visualize differences in microbiome composition.
- **PERMANOVA**: Estimating variance explained by different factors.
- **Filtering and CLR Transformation**: Filtering species based on abundance and prevalence, and applying centered log-ratio transformation.
- **Sequencing Depth Adjustment**: Evaluating sequencing depth influence on diversity and species abundance.
- **Association Analysis**: Conducting unadjusted and adjusted association analyses between microbial species and phenotypes.
- **Mediation Analysis**: Exploring the relationship between fruit intake, species abundance, and glucose levels.
